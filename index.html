                        <h4>blast of emotions</h4>
                        <p>The biggest question is... I have just too many questions, but... 
                          Why am I feeling insecure about Rex? Why... You are not...
                           Why am I the one who wants to talk to you? Why am I the one who always calls you?
                           
                           Why am I the one who is not in love with you but still waits for your calls and messages and all?
                            Why are you not the one? Like, even after I'm being confused, I'm not in love, I do all these shits, 
                          and you claim to be in love and not doing anything.
                           Why am I the one who's... Forget it. One time he says that he is not...
                           
                           You know, he doesn't consider himself human, he doesn't want to be part of all this shit...
                            And the next time, there was one time when he particularly made an excuse that that time he was very weak, his mentality got downgraded. 
                            He weakened himself and he asked me to give him an answer to whether I wanted to be with him or what.
                             And I was like, you know, you always say that you don't need an answer, you always say that you were just confessing and you don't need an answer,
                              it doesn't even matter what you say. So why are you asking me this right now?
                               And he said that maybe I am a human. He said that, you know, all this time he used to say, 
                               no, I'm not human, human. And then he was like, maybe I am a human, that's why I need an answer.
                                Sometimes he contradicts with his own ideas. I love when he... You know, I said that I love the feeling of... I once said to him that I love...
                                 that he loves me. And it was a whole mess. well maybe i can't explain it to him...i really don't know to to say..
                                I don't know. Maybe I'm gonna take an impulsive decision rather than a logical one. 
                                You know, he asked me to, he gave me two options. One was to go ahead with life, let's have no connections, let's move on from each other.
                                 And the second one was, let's be connected, we'll not talk. But then, because I gave him the, because I said a thing that I'm not mature enough to know whether I'm in love or not. 
                                 I need time, I need, this is the time when I have, I'm having hormonal changes and I don't wanna mistake love for some hormonal changes.
                                  So he said, when you will mature, let's, and if you find that you love me and all, then message me, I will respond. 
                                  So we'll basically not lose the connection, the contact, but we'll not talk. At this point, I just wanna say that, let's date. Let's be official so that I can ask you all the questions.  Or go and fuck yourself. Go ahead with your life.
                                   Let's talk every day or let's not talk. Nothing in middle. Either be completely mine or let me forget the idea that you can ever be mine. 
                                   Although I'm not ready for relationship, although this is not the time, although it will be online, I don't give a fuck.

                        <p>You know bbg, yesterday I was thinking about a lot of stuff. I remember doing something I would have never done. I mean, we're just friends, right? Although you love me, and although I say that I don't love you and I don't want to be in a relationship with you, I don't know why I searched this, about marriages and all. It's fucked up, but I was searching about the marriage features of Rajasthani weddings, and how much similar it is to what kind of wedding I go to. Crazy, right? Senior, see in which direction I'm going with my life. I'm not sure if you are proud of my decisions or not, but I'm sure you will support me. You know bbg is the kind of person who made me search these things, who made me blush and giggle and kick my legs and hair. He's a good person, and I can't believe that he's in my life...oh and the chatgpt approved hahaah !!!

                        <h4>next</h4>
                        <p>You know, I kind of asked him a lot to, you know, tell me why you love me, give me assurance, this and that, and he always created this environment that, if you will ask something, I will do it, you know, but sometimes I feel like, why am I asking? Like, it's not about asking too much, it's about why there is a need for me to ask him, why he can't always give me an assurance without asking, if you know what I mean. But then I feel like maybe it's too much, maybe that's how things are. I feel that he's being honest with me all the time, but then again I doubt it sometimes when he seems confused, like, I don't think he lied to me, but then I feel like lying is the most natural thing a human can do. I just don't trust that how can someone be this perfect. He's not perfect, he has flaws, but even after that. I don't know if he'll get close to another girl and feel the same or not, because, you know, let me share something, in his past relationship when he had a girlfriend, he talked with me, it was only chat, started related, but he talked. And although now he told me that even his ex used to read our chats, and she was free to read the chats of other girls, but it's funny that they broke up and I'm the next one he proposed. So me and his best friend, we were just casually saying that, okay, let's see after me who he would propose. I feel like what if we are in a relationship and he talked to one girl, and he also shared it to me, and I have the full access to view the chats, but after the breakup, what if she's the next one? </p>

                        <h4>random</h4>
                        <p>I was thinking of sharing this on call but I guess its good I mean I always knew this but I just think that I'm the very wrong person for everyone Like I am just always confused always delusional always annoying kind if I have to describe myself And I realized that because of my so called attachment issues with you I am making you suffer and also I am making myself miserable Like my mental peace is actually gone I can't focus on anything I don't know I just feel weird And I like you a lot Like a lot And we are not in a relationship so I can't say anything when you do something which I don't like And its okay from your side but I lose my mental peace thinking about it And there are a lot of times when I want to blame you when I feel like I am angry at you when I want to say a lot of things to you sometimes because of some things that you do But then I remember that we are just friends and that makes me sick.. . Because maybe from the day I told you that if you come here we will date I kind of assumed that we will date and I don't know what's going inside my little brain but its just not working properly.. . And I told you this even earlier that I check my phone snap whatsapp every possible place like I really check the drive that we made every single day just because I want to see if you have written something there I even check my emails like what if.. . And one thing I realized that you are just too good for me and I am just too bad for everyone.. . Your concept of love is different from mine because you know I haven't even found what true love is And I just can't digest the fact that how can you love someone and not text them or call them or you know point them out when they talk dry.. . Like I really don't get that concept of your love and which is fine because people have different thoughts.. . But I was born in this era and my concept of love revolves around what's going on I believe that if you love someone you can't live without texting them
